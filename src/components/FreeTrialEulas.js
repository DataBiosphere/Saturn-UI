const onixEula = `### Onix Networking Google Cloud Platform Online Customer Agreement\n\nOnix Networking Google Cloud Platform Online Customer Agreement (the\n\\"Agreement\\") is entered into by and between Onix Networking Corp., an\nOhio corporation, with offices at 18519 Detroit Avenue, Lakewood, Ohio\n44107 (“Onix”) and the entity agreeing to these terms (\\"Customer\\"). This\nAgreement is effective as of the date you click the \\"I Accept\\" button\nbelow (the \\"Effective Date\\"). If you are accepting on behalf of your\nemployer or another entity, you represent and warrant that: (i) you have\nfull legal authority to bind your employer, or the applicable entity, to\nthese terms and conditions; (ii) you have read and understand this\nAgreement; and (iii) you agree, on behalf of the party that you\nrepresent, to this Agreement. If you don't have the legal authority to\nbind your employer or the applicable entity, please do not click the \\"I\nAccept\\" button below. This Agreement governs Customer's access to and\nuse of the Services.\n\n1.  **Services**. “Services” means the Google services currently known\n    as “Google Cloud Platform” as set forth at the following URL:\n    <https://cloud.google.com/terms/services>, as provided by Google and\n    used by Customer under this Agreement. Customer may use any or all\n    of the services.\n    \n    1.  Google will provide the Services to Customer. As part of\n        receiving the Services Customer will have access to the Admin\n        Console, through which Customer may administer the Services. The\n        Services shall be deemed accepted by Customer upon provisioning\n        of Admin Console.\n    \n    2.  Customer must have an Account to use the Services, and is\n        responsible for the information it provides to create the\n        Account, the security of its passwords for the Account, and for\n        any use of its Account. If Customer becomes aware of any\n        unauthorized use of its password or its Account, Customer will\n        notify Onix or Google as promptly as possible.\n    \n    3.  Documentation. Google will provide Customer with Documentation.\n        The Documentation may specify restrictions on how the\n        Applications may be built or how the Services may be used and\n        Customer will ensure that Customer and its End Users comply with\n        such restrictions.\n    \n    4.  Customer agrees to comply with the terms and conditions of the\n        Service Specific Terms.\n    \n    5.  Customer agrees to comply with the terms and conditions of the\n        Google Cloud Platform Acceptable Use Policy (“AUP”).\n    \n    6.  Service Level Agreement. Google will provide the Services in\n        accordance with the applicable Service Level Agreement (“SLA”),\n        if any.\n    \n    7.  Data Location. Customer may select where certain Customer Data\n        will be stored (\\"Data Location Selection\\"), and Google will\n        store it there in accordance with the Service Specific Terms. If\n        a Data Location Selection is not covered by the Service Specific\n        Terms (or a Data Location Selection is not made by Customer in\n        respect of any Customer Data), Google may store and process the\n        relevant Customer Data anywhere Google or its Subprocessors\n        maintain facilities. By using the Services, Customer consents to\n        this processing and storage of Customer Data.\n    \n    8.  New Applications and Services. Google may: (i) make new\n        applications, tools, features or functionality available through\n        the Services and (ii) add new services to the “Services”\n        definition (by adding them at the URL under that definition),\n        the use of which may be contingent upon Customer’s agreement to\n        additional terms.\n    \n    9.  Modifications.\n        \n        1.  Modifications to the Services. Google may make commercially\n            reasonable updates to the Services from time to time. If\n            Google makes a material change to the Services, Onix will\n            make commercially reasonable efforts to inform Customer.\n        \n        2.  Modifications to the URL Terms. Google may make commercially\n            reasonable changes to the URL Terms from time to time. If\n            Google makes a material change to the URL Terms, Onix will\n            inform Customer through email notification or the Admin\n            Console. If the change has a material adverse impact on\n            Customer and is not a result of Google complying with a\n            court order or applicable law, Customer may notify Onix\n            within 30 days after being informed of the change that\n            Customer does not agree with the change. If Customer\n            notifies Onix as required, then Customer will remain\n            governed by the terms in effect immediately prior to the\n            change until the earlier of: (i) the end of the then-current\n            Initial Term (as defined in section 6.1 below) or Renewal\n            Term (as defined in section 6.2 below) or (ii) 12 months\n            after Onix informs Customer of the change, unless the\n            modification to the URL Terms is in response to a court\n            order or to comply with applicable law. If the Agreement\n            renews, it will do so under the updated URL Terms.\n    \n    10. Third Party Components. Certain components of the Software\n        (including open source software) may be subject to separate\n        license agreements, which Google will provide to Customer along\n        with such components.\n    \n    11. Use of Customer Data. Google will not access or use Customer\n        Data, except as necessary to provide the Services to Customer\n        and its End Users.\n    \n    12. Onix and Google are independent contractors and Onix is not\n        Google’s agent or partner or in a joint venture with Google.\n\n2.  **Customer Obligations.**\n    \n    13. Compliance. Customer is responsible for any violations of the\n        AUP, the Service Specific Terms, or Section 2.2 (Restrictions),\n        in each case caused by Customer (and Customer End Users),\n        Customer Data, Applications, or Projects. Google reserves the\n        right to review the Customer Data, Applications, and Projects\n        for compliance with the AUP.\n    \n    14. Restrictions. Customer will not, and will not allow any third\n        parties under its control or End Users to: (a) copy, modify,\n        create a derivative work of, reverse engineer, decompile,\n        translate, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to extract any or\n        all of the source code of the Services (subject to Section 1.10\n        above and except to the extent such restriction is expressly\n        prohibited by applicable law); (b) create multiple Applications,\n        Accounts, or Projects to simulate or act as a single\n        Application, Account, or Project (respectively) or otherwise\n        access the Services in a manner intended to avoid incurring\n        Fees; (c) unless otherwise stated in the Service Specific Terms,\n        use the Services to operate or enable any telecommunications\n        service or in connection with any Application that allows\n        Customer End Users to place calls or to receive calls from any\n        public switched telephone network; (d) process or store any\n        Customer Data that is subject to the International Traffic in\n        Arms Regulations maintained by the Department of State; (e) use\n        the Services for High Risk Activities; or (f) sublicense,\n        resell, or distribute any or all of the Services separate from\n        any integrated solution.\n    \n    15. Unless otherwise specified in writing by Google or Onix, Google\n        and Onix do not intend uses of the Services to create\n        obligations under HIPAA, and makes no representations that the\n        Services satisfy HIPAA requirements. If Customer is (or becomes)\n        a Covered Entity or Business Associate, as defined in HIPAA,\n        Customer agrees not to use the Services for any purpose or in\n        any manner involving Protected Health Information (as defined in\n        HIPAA) unless Customer has received prior written consent to\n        such use from Onix or Google. As between the parties, Customer\n        is solely responsible for any applicable compliance with HIPAA.\n\n3.  **Privacy**.\n    \n    16. The Data Processing and Security Terms will apply. Subject to\n        Section 3.2, Google may change the Data Processing and Security\n        Terms from time to time by notifying Customer in writing.\n    \n    17. Updates to Data Processing and Security Terms. Google may only\n        change the Data Processing and Security Terms where such change\n        is required to comply with applicable law, applicable\n        regulation, court order or guidance issued by a governmental\n        regulator or agency, where such change is expressly permitted by\n        the Data Processing and Security Terms, or where such change:\n        \n        3.  is commercially reasonable;\n        \n        4.  does not result in a degradation of the overall security of\n            the Services;\n        \n        5.  does not expand the scope of or remove any restrictions on\n            Google’s processing of Customer Personal Data, as described\n            in Section 5.3 (Scope of Processing) of the Data Processing\n            and Security Terms; and\n        \n        6.  does not otherwise have a material adverse impact on\n            Customer’s rights under the Data Processing and Security\n            Terms.\n    \n    18. Consent to Processing. Customer will obtain and maintain any\n        required consents necessary to permit the processing of Customer\n        Data under this Agreement.\n    \n    19. Google is a processor of any personal data processed by it on\n        Customer’s behalf, and Customer is the controller of any such\n        data, as the terms “controller”, “processed”, “processor” and\n        “personal data” are defined in the EU Directive.\n\n4.  **DMCA Policy**. Google provides information to help copyright\n    holders manage their intellectual property online, but Google cannot\n    determine whether something is being used legally or not without\n    their input. Google responds to notices of alleged copyright\n    infringement and terminates accounts of repeat infringers according\n    to the process in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If\n    Customer thinks somebody is violating Customer’s copyrights and\n    wants to notify Google, Customer can find information about\n    submitting notices, and Google's policy about responding to notices\n    at <http://www.google.com/dmca.html>.\n\n5.  **Suspension of Services.**\n    \n    20. Suspension/Removals. If Customer becomes aware that any\n        Application, Project , or Customer Data violates the AUP,\n        Customer will immediately suspend the Application, Project, or\n        End User’s access and/or remove the relevant Customer Data (as\n        applicable). If Customer fails to suspend or remove as noted in\n        the prior sentence, Google or Onix may specifically request that\n        Customer do so. If Customer fails to comply with Google’s or\n        Onix’ request to do so, then Google or Onix may suspend the\n        Customer’s or applicable End Users’ Google accounts, disable the\n        Project or Application, or disable the Account (as may be\n        applicable) until the AUP violation is corrected..\n    \n    21. Emergency Security Issues. Despite the foregoing, if there is an\n        Emergency Security Issue, then Onix or Google may automatically\n        suspend the offending Application, Project, or the Account.\n        Suspension will be to the minimum extent required, and of the\n        minimum duration, to prevent or resolve the Emergency Security\n        Issue. If Onix or Google suspends an Application, Project, or\n        the Account, for any reason, without prior notice to Customer,\n        then at Customer’s request, Onix or Google will provide Customer\n        the reason for the suspension as soon as reasonably possible.\n\n6.  **Term and Termination**.\n    \n    22. Agreement Term. Subject to Customer’s payment of Fees, the\n        Initial Term will start on the Agreement effective date and\n        continue for a period of twelve (12) months, unless terminated\n        earlier in accordance with this Agreement.\n    \n    23. Auto Renewal. At the end of the Initial Term, the Agreement will\n        automatically renew for consecutive terms of twelve (12) months\n        (each a “Renewal Term”), unless terminated earlier in accordance\n        with this Agreement.\n    \n    24. Termination for Breach. Either party may suspend or terminate\n        this Agreement for breach if: (i) the other party is in material\n        breach of the Agreement and fails to cure that breach within\n        thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice; (ii) the other\n        party ceases its business operations or becomes subject to\n        insolvency proceedings and the proceedings are not dismissed\n        within ninety (90) days; or (iii) the other party is in material\n        breach of this Agreement more than two times notwithstanding any\n        cure of such breaches. Where Onix has the right to terminate\n        this Agreement under this Section, Onix may suspend or terminate\n        any, all, or any portion of the Services or Projects.\n    \n    25. Termination for Inactivity. Onix reserves the right to terminate\n        the Services for inactivity, if, for a period exceeding one\n        hundred and eighty (180) days, Customer (a) has failed to access\n        the Admin Console, (b) a Project has no active virtual machine\n        or storage resources or an Application has not served any\n        requests; and (c) no invoices are being generated.\n    \n    26. Termination for Convenience. Customer may stop using the Service\n        at any time.\n    \n    27. Effects of Termination. If the Agreement expires or is\n        terminated, then: (i) the rights granted by one Party to the\n        other will immediately cease; (ii) all Fees (including Taxes)\n        owed by Customer to Onix are immediately due upon receipt of the\n        final invoice; (iii) Customer will delete the Software, and any\n        Application, Instance, Project, and any Customer Data from the\n        Services; and (iv) upon request, each Party will use\n        commercially reasonable efforts to return or destroy all\n        Confidential Information of the other party in its possession.\n\n7.  **Technical Support Services (TSS)**.\n    \n    28. Customer is responsible for technical support of its\n        Applications and Projects.\n    \n    29. Subject to payment of applicable support Fees, Google and/or\n        Onix will provide TSS to Customer during the License Term in\n        accordance with the TSS Guidelines as specified at\n        <https://cloud.google.com/terms/tssg>.\n\n8.  **Deprecation Policy.**\n    \n    30. Google may discontinue any Services or any portion or feature of\n        the Services for any reason at any time without liability to\n        Customer.\n    \n    31. Notwithstanding Section 8.1, if Google intends to discontinue or\n        make backwards incompatible changes to those Services that are\n        specified at <https://cloud.google.com/cloud/terms/deprecation>\n        (“Deprecation URL”), Google will announce such change or\n        discontinuance and will use commercially reasonable efforts to\n        continue to operate those versions and features of those\n        Services identified at the Deprecation URL without these changes\n        for at least one year after that announcement, unless (as Google\n        determines in its reasonable good faith judgment):\n        \n        7.  required by law or third party relationship (including if\n            there is a change in applicable law or relationship), or\n        \n        8.  doing so could create a security risk or substantial\n            economic or material technical burden.\n    \n    32. The above policy in Section 8.2 is the “Deprecation Policy”.\n\n9.  **Fees and Billing**.\n    \n    33. Usage and Invoicing. Customer will pay for all Fees based on:\n        (a) Customer’s use of the Services; (b) any Reserved Units\n        selected; (c) any Committed Purchases selected; and/or (d) any\n        Package Purchases selected. Onix will invoice Customer on a\n        monthly basis for those Fees accrued at the end of each month\n        unless otherwise stated at the URL designating the Fees for an\n        applicable SKU. Fees are solely based on Google's measurements\n        of use of the Services under Customer’s Account and Google’s\n        determination is final.\n    \n    34. Payment. Fees are due thirty (30) days from the invoice date.\n        All payments due are in U.S. dollars. Customer’s obligation to\n        pay all Fees is non-cancellable.\n    \n    35. Taxes. Customer is responsible for paying any Taxes, and\n        Customer will pay the Fees to Onix without any deduction. If\n        Onix is obligated to collect or remit Taxes imposed on Customer,\n        the appropriate amount will be invoiced to and paid by Customer,\n        unless Customer provides Onix with a timely and valid tax\n        exemption certificate (or other documentation as required for\n        the exemption) authorized by the appropriate taxing authority.\n    \n    36. Any terms and conditions on a purchase order do not apply to\n        this Agreement and are null and void.\n\n10. **Warranty**.\n\n  > EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR HEREIN, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT\n  > PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ONIX AND GOOGLE DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER\n  > WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR\n  > OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n  > FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. ONIX AND ITS\n  > SUPPLIERS ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR THE DELETION OF OR FAILURE\n  > TO STORE ANY CUSTOMER DATA AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS MAINTAINED OR\n  > TRANSMITTED THROUGH USE OF THE SERVICES. CUSTOMER IS SOLELY\n  > RESPONSIBLE FOR SECURING AND BACKING UP ITS APPLICATION, PROJECT, AND\n  > CUSTOMER DATA. NEITHER ONIX NOR GOOGLE, WARRANTS THAT THE OPERATION OF\n  > THE SOFTWARE OR THE SERVICES WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED.\n  > NEITHER THE SOFTWARE NOR THE SERVICES ARE DESIGNED, MANUFACTURED, OR\n  > INTENDED FOR HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES.\n\n11. **Intellectual Property Rights**.\n    \n    37. Except as expressly set forth herein, this Agreement does not\n        grant either party any rights, implied or otherwise, to the\n        other’s content or any of the other’s intellectual property. As\n        between the parties, Customer owns all Intellectual Property\n        Rights in Customer Data and the Application or Project (if\n        applicable) and Google owns all Intellectual Property Rights in\n        the Services and Software.\n    \n    38. Services Feedback. If Customer provides Feedback to Google, then\n        Google may use that information without obligation to Customer,\n        and Customer irrevocably assigns to Google all right, title, and\n        interest in the Feedback..\n\n12. **Confidentiality.**\n    \n    39. Confidential Information. “Confidential Information” is\n        information disclosed by one Party to the other Party under this\n        Agreement that is marked as confidential or would normally under\n        the circumstances be considered confidential information of the\n        disclosing party. Confidential Information does not include\n        information that the recipient already knew, that becomes public\n        through no fault of the recipient, that was independently\n        developed by the recipient, or that was rightfully given to the\n        recipient by another party.\n    \n    40. Confidentiality Obligations. The recipient of the other Party's\n        Confidential Information will not disclose the Confidential\n        Information, except to Affiliates, employees, agents, or\n        professional advisors who need to know it and who have agreed in\n        writing (or in the case of professional advisors are otherwise\n        bound) to keep it confidential. The recipient will ensure that\n        those people and entities use the Confidential Information only\n        to exercise rights and fulfill obligations under this Agreement,\n        while using reasonable care to keep it confidential. The\n        recipient may also disclose Confidential Information when\n        required by law after giving reasonable notice to the discloser\n        if allowed by law. Customer is responsible for responding to all\n        third party requests concerning its use and its End Users' use\n        of the Services.\n\n13. **Indemnity.**\n    \n    41. By Customer. Customer will defend and indemnify Onix and its\n        Affiliates against Indemnified Liabilities in any Third-Party\n        Legal Proceeding to the extent arising from: (i) any Integrated\n        Solution, Application, Project, Customer Data, or Customer Brand\n        Features; or (ii) Customer’s or its End Users’, use of the\n        Services in violation of the AUP.\n    \n    42. By Onix. Onix will defend and indemnify Customer against\n        Indemnified Liabilities in any Third-Party Legal Proceeding to\n        the extent arising from a third party claim that Google's\n        technology used to provide the Service (excluding any open\n        source software) or any Google Brand Feature infringes or\n        misappropriates any patent, copyright, trade secret or trademark\n        of such third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event\n        shall Onix have any obligations or liability under this Section\n        arising from: (i) use of any Service or Google Brand Features in\n        a modified form or in combination with materials not furnished\n        by Google or Onix, and (ii) any Customer Data.\n\n14. **Limitation of Liability.**\n    \n    43. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW AND SUBJECT TO\n        SECTION 14.3 (EXCEPTIONS TO LIMITATIONS), IN NO EVENT WILL\n        EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,\n        PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING,\n        WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF DATA OR\n        LOSS OF GOODWILL), ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS\n        AGREEMENT OR THE PERFORMANCE OR OPERATION OF THE LICENSES,\n        WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON BREACH\n        OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE),\n        PRODUCT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT SUCH PARTY\n        HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n    \n    44. EACH PARTY'S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR DIRECT DAMAGES\n        ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIMITED TO THE\n        FEES CUSTOMER PAID UNDER THE AGREEMENT DURING THE 12 MONTHS\n        BEFORE THE LIABILITY AROSE.\n    \n    45. EXCEPTIONS TO LIMITATIONS.

Google may update or modify\nsuch Security Measures from time to time provided that such updates and\nmodifications do not result in the degradation of the overall security\nof the Services.\n\n**1. Data Center and Network Security**\n\n(a) Data Centers.\n\nInfrastructure. Google maintains geographically distributed data\ncenters. Google stores all production data in physically secure data\ncenters.\n\nRedundancy. Infrastructure systems have been designed to eliminate\nsingle points of failure and minimize the impact of anticipated\nenvironmental risks. Dual circuits, switches, networks or other\nnecessary devices help provide this redundancy. The Services are\ndesigned to allow Google to perform certain types of preventative and\ncorrective maintenance without interruption. All environmental equipment\nand facilities have documented preventative maintenance procedures that\ndetail the process for and frequency of performance in accordance with\nthe manufacturer’s or internal specifications. Preventative and\ncorrective maintenance of the data center equipment is scheduled through\na standard change process according to documented procedures.\n\nPower. The data center electrical power systems are designed to be\nredundant and maintainable without impact to continuous operations, 24\nhours a day, 7 days a week. In most cases, a primary as well as an\nalternate power source, each with equal capacity, is provided for\ncritical infrastructure components in the data center. Backup power is\nprovided by various mechanisms such as uninterruptible power supplies\n(UPS) batteries, which supply consistently reliable power protection\nduring utility brownouts, blackouts, over voltage, under voltage, and\nout-of-tolerance frequency conditions. If utility power is interrupted,\nbackup power is designed to provide transitory power to the data center,\nat full capacity, for up to 10 minutes until the diesel generator\nsystems take over. The diesel generators are capable of automatically\nstarting up within seconds to provide enough emergency electrical power\nto run the data center at full capacity typically for a period of days.\n\nServer Operating Systems. Google servers use a Linux based\nimplementation customized for the application environment. Data is\nstored using proprietary algorithms to augment data security and\nredundancy. Google employs a code review process to increase the\nsecurity of the code used to provide the Services and enhance the\nsecurity products in production environments.\n\nBusinesses Continuity. Google replicates data over multiple systems to\nhelp to protect against accidental destruction or loss. Google has\ndesigned and regularly plans and tests its business continuity\nplanning/disaster recovery programs.\n\n(b) Networks and Transmission.\n\nData Transmission. Data centers are typically connected via high-speed\nprivate links to provide secure and fast data transfer between data\ncenters. This is designed to prevent data from being read, copied,\naltered or removed without authorization during electronic transfer or\ntransport or while being recorded onto data storage media. Google\ntransfers data via Internet standard protocols.\n\nExternal Attack Surface. Google employs multiple layers of network\ndevices and intrusion detection to protect its external attack surface.\nGoogle considers potential attack vectors and incorporates appropriate\npurpose built technologies into external facing systems.\n\nIntrusion Detection. Intrusion detection is intended to provide insight\ninto ongoing attack activities and provide adequate information to\nrespond to incidents. Google intrusion detection involves:\n\n(i) tightly controlling the size and make-up of Google’s attack surface\nthrough preventative measures;\n\n(ii) employing intelligent detection controls at data entry points; and\n\n(iii) employing technologies that automatically remedy certain dangerous\nsituations.\n\nIncident Response. Google monitors a variety of communication channels\nfor security incidents, and Google’s security personnel will react\npromptly to known incidents.\n\nEncryption Technologies. Google makes HTTPS encryption (also referred to\nas SSL or TLS connection) available.\n\n**2. Access and Site Controls**\n\n(a) Site Controls.\n\nOn-site Data Center Security Operation. Google’s data centers maintain\nan on-site security operation responsible for all physical data center\nsecurity functions 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The on-site security\noperation personnel monitor closed circuit TV (CCTV) cameras and all\nalarm systems. On-site security operation personnel perform internal and\nexternal patrols of the data center regularly.\n\nData Center Access Procedures. Google maintains formal access procedures\nfor allowing physical access to the data centers. The data centers are\nhoused in facilities that require electronic card key access, with\nalarms that are linked to the on-site security operation. All entrants\nto the data center are required to identify themselves as well as show\nproof of identity to on-site security operations. Only authorized\nemployees, contractors and visitors are allowed entry to the data\ncenters. Only authorized employees and contractors are permitted to\nrequest electronic card key access to these facilities. Data center\nelectronic card key access requests must be made through e-mail, and\nrequires the approval of the requestor’s manager and the data center\ndirector. All other entrants requiring temporary data center access\nmust: (i) obtain approval in advance from the data center managers for\nthe specific data center and internal areas they wish to visit; (ii)\nsign in at on-site security operations; and (iii) reference an approved\ndata center access record identifying the individual as approved.\n\nOn-site Data Center Security Devices. Google’s data centers employ an\nelectronic card key and biometric access control system that is linked\nto a system alarm. The access control system monitors and records each\nindividual’s electronic card key and when they access perimeter doors,\nshipping and receiving, and other critical areas. Unauthorized activity\nand failed access attempts are logged by the access control system and\ninvestigated, as appropriate. Authorized access throughout the business\noperations and data centers is restricted based on zones and the\nindividual’s job responsibilities. The fire doors at the data centers\nare alarmed. CCTV cameras are in operation both inside and outside the\ndata centers. The positioning of the cameras has been designed to cover\nstrategic areas including, among others, the perimeter, doors to the\ndata center building, and shipping/receiving. On-site security\noperations personnel manage the CCTV monitoring, recording and control\nequipment. Secure cables throughout the data centers connect the CCTV\nequipment. Cameras record on site via digital video recorders 24 hours a\nday, 7 days a week. The surveillance records are retained for up to 30\ndays based on activity.\n\n(b) Access Control.\n\nInfrastructure Security Personnel. Google has, and maintains, a security\npolicy for its personnel, and requires security training as part of the\ntraining package for its personnel. Google’s infrastructure security\npersonnel are responsible for the ongoing monitoring of Google’s\nsecurity infrastructure, the review of the Services, and responding to\nsecurity incidents.\n\nAccess Control and Privilege Management. Customer’s administrators must\nauthenticate themselves via a central authentication system or via a\nsingle sign on system in order to administer the Services.\n\nInternal Data Access Processes and Policies – Access Policy. Google’s\ninternal data access processes and policies are designed to prevent\nunauthorized persons and/or systems from gaining access to systems used\nto process personal data. Google designs its systems to (i) only allow\nauthorized persons to access data they are authorized to access; and\n(ii) ensure that personal data cannot be read, copied, altered or\nremoved without authorization during processing, use and after\nrecording. The systems are designed to detect any inappropriate access.\nGoogle employs a centralized access management system to control\npersonnel access to production servers, and only provides access to a\nlimited number of authorized personnel. LDAP, Kerberos and a proprietary\nsystem utilizing RSA keys are designed to provide Google with secure and\nflexible access mechanisms. These mechanisms are designed to grant only\napproved access rights to site hosts, logs, data and configuration\ninformation. Google requires the use of unique user IDs, strong\npasswords, two factor authentication and carefully monitored access\nlists to minimize the potential for unauthorized account use. The\ngranting or modification of access rights is based on: the authorized\npersonnel’s job responsibilities; job duty requirements necessary to\nperform authorized tasks; and a need to know basis. The granting or\nmodification of access rights must also be in accordance with Google’s\ninternal data access policies and training. Approvals are managed by\nworkflow tools that maintain audit records of all changes. Access to\nsystems is logged to create an audit trail for accountability. Where\npasswords are employed for authentication (e.g., login to workstations),\npassword policies that follow at least industry standard practices are\nimplemented. These standards include password expiry, restrictions on\npassword reuse and sufficient password strength. For access to extremely\nsensitive information (e.g. credit card data), Google uses hardware\ntokens.\n\n**3. Data**\n\n(a) Data Storage, Isolation and Logging. Google stores data in a\nmulti-tenant environment on Google-owned servers. The data and file\nsystem architecture are replicated between multiple geographically\ndispersed data centers. Google also logically isolates the Customer’s\ndata. Customer will be given control over specific data sharing\npolicies. Those policies, in accordance with the functionality of the\nServices, will enable Customer to determine the product sharing settings\napplicable to Customer End Users for specific purposes. Customer may\nchoose to make use of certain logging capability that Google may make\navailable via the Services.\n\n(b) Decommissioned Disks and Disk Erase Policy. Certain disks containing\ndata may experience performance issues, errors or hardware failure that\nlead them to be decommissioned (“Decommissioned Disk”). Every\nDecommissioned Disk is subject to a series of data destruction processes\n(the “Disk Erase Policy”) before leaving Google’s premises either for\nreuse or destruction. Decommissioned Disks are erased in a multi-step\nprocess and verified complete by at least two independent validators.\nThe erase results are logged by the Decommissioned Disk’s serial number\nfor tracking. Finally, the erased Decommissioned Disk is released to\ninventory for reuse and redeployment. If, due to hardware failure, the\nDecommissioned Disk cannot be erased, it is securely stored until it can\nbe destroyed. Each facility is audited regularly to monitor compliance\nwith the Disk Erase Policy.\n\n**4. Personnel Security**\n\nGoogle personnel are required to conduct themselves in a manner\nconsistent with the company’s guidelines regarding confidentiality,\nbusiness ethics, appropriate usage, and professional standards. Google\nconducts reasonably appropriate backgrounds checks to the extent legally\npermissible and in accordance with applicable local labor law and\nstatutory regulations.\n\nPersonnel are required to execute a confidentiality agreement and must\nacknowledge receipt of, and compliance with, Google’s confidentiality\nand privacy policies. Personnel are provided with security training.\nPersonnel handling Customer Data are required to complete additional\nrequirements appropriate to their role (eg., certifications). Google’s\npersonnel will not process Customer Data without authorization.\n\n**5. Subprocessor Security**\n\nPrior to onboarding Subprocessors, Google conducts an audit of the\nsecurity and privacy practices of Subprocessors to ensure Subprocessors\nprovide a level of security and privacy appropriate to their access to\ndata and the scope of the services they are engaged to provide. Once\nGoogle has assessed the risks presented by the Subprocessor, then\nsubject to the requirements set out in Section 11.2 (Subprocessing\nRestrictions) of these Terms, the Subprocessor is required to enter into\nappropriate security, confidentiality and privacy contract terms.\n\nNote: By clicking on the box you are indicating you have read this\nAgreement and agree to the Terms of Use above including the Terms\nrepeated\nhere:\n\n<https://cloud.google.com/terms/services>\n\n<http://www.google.com/dmca.html>\n\n<https://cloud.google.com/terms/tssg>\n\n<https://cloud.google.com/cloud/terms/deprecation>\n\n<https://cloud.google.com/cloud/terms/aup>\n\nhttps://cloud.google.com/docs\n\n<https://cloud.google.com/skus>\n\n<https://cloud.google.com/cloud/services>\n\n<https://cloud.google.com/terms/service-terms>\n\n<https://cloud.google.com/terms/sla>\n`
