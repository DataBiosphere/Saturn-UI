 * NOTE: These options are deprecated as of marked 0.7.0, and may be removed in a future version.
 * Currently, we're using them to effectively disallow literal HTML in user-authored markdown,
 * e.g. workspace descriptions. The official recommendation from the library is to apply an HTML
 * sanitizer to the output of marked(), but this would result in a change in behavior for us, since
 * it would effectively allow (well-formed) literal HTML to pass through.
 *
 * Because of this, we've delayed this upgrade as long as possible. If we're forced into it (by a
 * security issue) and there's no alternative solution available, we may need to find another
 * library.
